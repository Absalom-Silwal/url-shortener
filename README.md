# url-shortener
A backend URL shortener service that generates unique short links, handles redirection, and tracks basic analytics, built with a focus on clean architecture and scalability.

# Problem Statement
Design and implement a scalable, highly available URL shortening service that converts long URLs into short, unique links and efficiently redirects users while handling high read traffic, failures, and abuse.

# Functional Requirements
- System should be able to generate unique short url generation from long url
- System should be able to redirect to long url on short url given

# Non Functional Requirements
- System should be highly available.
- System should be horizontally scalable (adding more servers) at the peak time. 
- System should performed at low latency(less time between request and server response).
- The short urls generated by the system should be highly unpredictable.
